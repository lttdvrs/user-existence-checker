# Username Existence Checker

 The **Username Availability Checker** is a  tool designed for determining the availability of a specific username across a range of online platforms. The tool offers a fast and accurate assessment of the username registration status.

This tool is intended for entertainment and informational purposes only.

## Installation and usage
Install the required dependencies:

	> pip install requirements.txt
Running the script:

    > python scanner.py


When prompted enter the username to perform the scan on.

## Customization

Users can adapt the script to their needs by altering the `URLS` dictionary in the `utils/constants.py` file. This dictionary should contain the requisite parameters for each website, such as URL format, HTML elements to search for, and key indicators in JSON responses.

## Future Additions

Plans for future development include transforming this script into an API and expanding its capabilities with more options and websites. This might require **API keys** for the script to run on **your** device.


## Disclaimer

As these methods used are subject to change, regular updates to the script may be necessary to maintain its accuracy and effectiveness across all supported platforms. I will try my best to keep up with these, please feel free to create new **issues** on this.
